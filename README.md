# library-management-system
The provided Java code implements a simple Library Management System that allows users to manage a collection of books. The system provides functionality to add new books, display all books, and search for books by their title.
This Java code provides a basic implementation of a Library Management System. It uses an ArrayList to manage a collection of books, allowing users to add, view, and search for books. The system interacts with users via the console, taking input and displaying appropriate messages based on the operations performed. The Book class serves as a blueprint for creating book objects with relevant details. This code is a good starting point for building a more comprehensive library management system with additional features such as user management, borrowing and returning books, and fine calculations.
